1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
		The most interesting topic that we have covered in our domain so far is being able to identify potential biases in machine learning models and datasets. More specifically, how we can utilize different metrics like balanced accuracy, 1-min(DI/ 1/DI) value, average odds difference, statistical parity difference, equal opportunity difference, and Theil index value.
		
2.  Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
		One potential investigation that I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is how can we pragmatically identify biases within datasets and notify the user before they begin training any model of some sort.

3.  What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
		A potential change that I would make to the approach we took would be to focus more on the data processing steps. I believe that the data is full of inherent biases that we neglected but could have been handled using adequate transformations and sampling techniques.

4.  What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
		Other techniques that I might be interested in for our project would be to see how we can incorporate this automatic bias identification by testing it on different datasets and models. It would be fascinating to see how effective it is across different industries within different datasets that may face different types of biases.
